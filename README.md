# Token Display

## About The Project

Token Display is a web application designed to simplify the process of viewing and managing electric meter token return messages. These messages, often received after purchasing electricity tokens, can contain multiple sequences, each representing a token. Our tool parses these messages, displaying each token sequence individually for a streamlined user experience.

### Features

- **Token Parsing:** Extracts and displays token sequences from bulk meter token return messages.
- **Sequential Display:** Allows users to view each token sequence one by one.
- **Navigation Controls:** Provides "Previous Token" and "Next Token" buttons for easy navigation between token sequences.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for simplicity and ease of use.

## Getting Started

To use Token Display, follow these steps:

1. **Copy** the entire message from your meter token return message.
2. **Paste** it into the input box on the Token Display site.
3. **Navigate** through the tokens using the provided buttons to view each sequence individually.

## How It Works

The site processes the pasted meter token return message to identify and separate each token sequence. It then displays these sequences one by one, making it easier for users to manage and use their tokens effectively.
